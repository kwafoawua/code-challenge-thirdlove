## Used Libraries

* [EmotionJs](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion): Every component is styled using this CSS-in-JS library. It allows me to create reusable styled components.
* [StoryBook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook): I used this it to develop the UI of each styled component. 
* [Ramnda](https://ramdajs.com/): I used it to apply functional programming.
* [Nuka Carousel](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/nuka-carousel): It's a pure ReactJS Component to create Carousel galleries. It's easy to configurate and the style can be modified using emotionjs as well.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): I configured the project for developer and production mode using webpack.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): it converts ECMAScript 2015+ code into a compatible version of JavaScript for current and older browsers.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): I used React Javascript Library to develop the user interface.
